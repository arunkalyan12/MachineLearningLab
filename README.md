# Machine Learning Lab

Welcome to the Machine Learning Lab repository! This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms and techniques in Python. The code is primarily located in the `Lab.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, and the respective datasets used in the experiments are included as well.

## Algorithms and Techniques Implemented

1. **FIND-S Algorithm**
   - FIND-S is a simple algorithm used for concept learning in machine learning. It finds the most specific hypothesis that fits the positive examples.

2. **Candidate-Elimination Algorithm**
   - This algorithm maintains a version space of hypotheses that are consistent with the training examples. It is used for learning in the concept space and involves two sets: the general and specific sets.

3. **ID3 Algorithm**
   - The ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm is used for creating decision trees. It selects the attribute that maximizes information gain to split the data.

4. **Backpropagation**
   - Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used for training artificial neural networks. It updates the weights of the network by propagating the error backward through the network.

5. **Bayesian Classifier**
   - A Bayesian classifier uses Bayes' theorem to predict the class of a given instance based on the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the features.

6. **Bayesian Classifier for Text**
   - This variant of the Bayesian classifier is specifically designed for text classification tasks, often using the Naive Bayes approach for handling text data.

7. **Bayesian Network**
   - A Bayesian network represents probabilistic relationships among a set of variables. It is used for reasoning under uncertainty and for performing probabilistic inference.

8. **k-Means Clustering**
   - The k-Means algorithm is a popular clustering method that partitions data into k clusters based on feature similarity.

9. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
   - The k-NN algorithm is a simple classification technique that classifies instances based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.

10. **Non-Parametric Locally Weighted Regression (LWLR)**
    - LWLR is a regression technique that fits a local model to the data. It is used for smoothing and predicting based on local data points.
